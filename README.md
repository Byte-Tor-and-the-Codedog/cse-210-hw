In 1206 a young humble herder named Temujin had finally triumphed over the regional disputes between his own tribes and allies against the Merkit and other invaders who had raided them and kidnapped his wife. At the celebration he took on the title 'Chinggis Khan' which, translated means "King of the Expanse". He swore the Baljuna covenant with his friends which consisted of Turkic Muslims, Buddhists from Tibet, and even Christians from the Qara Khitai tribe. This loose group of Nomads who had fought for each other one day became the largest continuos empire in history.
